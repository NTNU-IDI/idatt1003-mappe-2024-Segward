## Project description

[//]: # (TODO: Write a short description of your project/product here.)

In this project we had to make a grocery storage system where you could register, remove, list groceries and more. We also had to implement recipies and cooking books. The enduser should be able to check what they had in storage and what they could make with the ingredients they had. The project had to be made in Java with a maven project structure. Furthermore we had to implement full JUnit testing and JavaDoc documentation.

## Project structure

[//]: # (TODO: Describe the structure of your project here. How have you used packages in your structure. Where are all sourcefiles stored. Where are all JUnit-test classes stored. etc.)

The source code can be found in `src/main/java/edu/ntnu/idi/idatt` and the JUnit-test classes can be found in `src/test/java/edu/ntnu/idi/idatt`
